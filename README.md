# bookmarks_from_javascript
The purpose of this article is create a list of bookmarks, and present the URLs using plain JS. The underlying purpose is to understand how things work behind the scenes, and cover one of the fundamental pillars used in modern JS frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue. So the example itself is not that difficult to achieve, but the concept is what is important.
